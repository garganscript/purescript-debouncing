  # Optional section for configuring the `spago publish` command.

  publish:
    # The version of your package. This follows semver rules, but with no
    # prereleases - so only major.minor.patch.
    version: 0.1.2

    # Optional list of globs to exclude from the published archive, in

    # Note that the Registry will first apply the `include` list, then
    # the `exclude` one, as detailed in the specification:

    exclude:

      # The place where the Registry will fetch the source from.
      # This is optional since you might want to release the code without
      # publishing to the Registry, which is what this is needed for.
